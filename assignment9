#Q1, Create a vehicle class with an init method having instance variables as name_of_vehicle, max_speed 
#and average_of_vehicle. 
ans = class vehicle:
    
    def __init__(self, name_of_vehicle , max_speed , average_of_vcehicle):
        self.name_of_vehicle  = name_of_vehicle
        self.max_speed =        max_speed
        self.average_of_vehicle=9
        
a = vehicle("ferrari" ,400 , 11)  

a.name_of_vehicle

'ferrari'
        
        
#Q2.  Create a child class car from the vehicle class created in Que 1, which will inherit the vehicle class. 
#Create a method named seating_capacity which takes capacity as an argument and returns the name of 
#the vehicle and its seating capacity.

ans = 
class vehicle:
    
    def __init__(self, name_of_vehicle , max_speed , average_of_vcehicle):
        self.name_of_vehicle  = name_of_vehicle

        return "the name car is ferrari"
        
            

#Q3. What is multiple inheritance? Write a python code to demonstrate multiple inheritance.

ans = when a child class inherits from the more then one class .i.e., this child class derived from multiple classes, we can cxall it multiple inheritance.

class tst1:
    
    def test(self):
        return "this is a 1st base class"
class tst2:
    
    def test1(self):
        return "this is 2nd base clsss"  

class tst3(tst1 , tst2):
    pass    
    

#Q4. What are getter and setter in python? Create a class and create a getter and a setter method in this 
#class.
ans = Getter: A method that allows you to access an attribute in a given class. Setter: A method that allows you to set or mutate the value of an attribute in a class.
 
class btech:
    
    def __init__(self, no_of_electrical_student):

    def set_value(self , no_of_electrical_student):
        self.__no_of_electrical_student = no_of_electrical_student
        
        
    def get_value(self):
        return self.__no_of_electrical_student
        
        

#Q5.What is method overriding in python? Write a python code to demonstrate method overriding
ans = when you have two different method of same name and also each method perform different task.

    def show(self):
        print('this is parent class')
